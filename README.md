# Demand-Forecast-for-Optimized-Inventory-Planning
Forecasting 2 week of a retail store inventory
This project revolves around forecasting the future demand for items in a retail store using historical transaction data. The goal is to predict how many units of each item the store will need in the next two weeks, an essential task in supply chain management. 
The notebook available presents part of the EDA done to the moment. Future EDA and ML methods deployment will soon be uploaded. The project has broader applications in the retail industry, where efficient stock forecasting is crucial for ensuring products are readily available while minimizing excess inventory.
